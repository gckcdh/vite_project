**Setting up Vite for a JavaScript Project**

**Scenario:** You are tasked with creating a JavaScript application using Vite as the build tool and development server. You need to set up the project from scratch and configure Vite to work with JavaScript.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialize a Project:**
    
    Start by creating a new directory for your project and open a terminal in that directory.
    
    ```bash
    mkdir my-vite-js-app
    cd my-vite-js-app
    ```
    
2. **Initialize a Vite Project:**
    
    Initialize a Vite project with the following command, choosing the "vanilla" template for a JavaScript-only project:
    
    ```bash
    npm init vite@latest
    ```
    
    Follow the prompts to configure your project:
    
    - Project name: (Your choice)
    - Template: Choose "vanilla."
3. **Install Project Dependencies:**
    
    After Vite generates the project structure, install the project dependencies.
    
    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    npm install
    ```
    
4. **Run the Development Server:**
    
    Start the development server to ensure everything is set up correctly.
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    Access the development server in your browser (typically at **`http://localhost:3000`**) to confirm that the JavaScript application is running.
    
5. **Modify Your JavaScript App:**
    
    Edit the generated JavaScript files or create new ones to customize your application. You can modify the files in the **`src`** directory.
    
6. **Configure Vite:**
    
    Create or modify a Vite configuration file (usually **`vite.config.js`**) to customize your development and build settings. For example, you can configure CSS pre-processors, set up aliases, or specify custom build options.
    
7. **Building for Production:**
    
    Create a production build of your JavaScript app.
    
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    
    Review the generated files in the **`dist`** directory, which you can deploy to a web server.
    
8. **Documentation and Presentation:**
    
    Document the steps you took in a README file, including any additional configurations or customizations you made in your Vite configuration. Explain the purpose and effects of the configuration options you set.
